# exercises-in-style
Hi everybody! Welcome to my "exercise in style" space!
Here, I am going to share anything that comes to my mind/solutions I develop during my work, or my take on beautiful CSS animations I find while surfing online.
Please, be merciful with me :smile: 
This is my playground and **<u>I am sure</u>** that everything I put here could be done better! 
(Expecially for Node script. I don't know Node **AT ALL** but I needed those script to facilitate my work.)
I am definitely open to any of you ready to give advice on how to improve my work.

Thanks
Francesca
